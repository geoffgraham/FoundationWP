A TwentyFourteen child theme mashed up with Foundation 5. This is basically what it would look like (with slight variation) to install Foundation into a WordPress directory using the command line.

## Installation

Clone or download the repository. Drop the contents into your project's root directory. This repo includes a full WordPress installation.

Follow the same installation instructions for WordPress:
